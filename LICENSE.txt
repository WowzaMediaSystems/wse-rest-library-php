notice described in Exhibit A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the Source Code where You describe 
recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to Covered Code.

rights from Wowza pursuant to Section 1.a; (b) You do not have any rights from other Contributors pursuant to Section 2.a; and
